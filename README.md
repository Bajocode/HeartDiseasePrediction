## Data

This project aims to generate a model to predict the presence of a heart disease. [The UCI heart disease database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/) contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14. The target attribute is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. However, for sake of simplicity it will be reduced to binary classification, i.e, `0` vs `0 <`. 

*The authors of the databases: Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.*
